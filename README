This package does not contain any decryption software itself - it requires
'dvdbackup' to be installed in order to decrypt the VOB files.

The script just takes your DVD-ROM device as an argument - no other options
are required.

The resulting output ISO is a duplicate of the original DVD, with decrypted
VOBs replacing the original ones.  Menus, jacket cover images, DVD-ROM PC
content, etc. is all preserved.
